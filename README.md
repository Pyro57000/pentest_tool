# pentest_tool
A quick little tool to manage which projects you're on, keep track of time spent on those projects, and manage distrobox containers for each environment.

In order to use this tool you'll want to have distrobox set up and have a "template" box you've created that has all yoru tools installed and what not, you'll likely also want to have a folder full of your other custom tools that you get from git hub, this makes it easier.
